# qgis_range_filters
A legend widget for doing range filtering of numeric attributes of a QGIS layer. Motivated by needing to explore a large dataset, I wrote this question: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/328818/using-qgis-slider-for-filtering-based-on-attributes/329109#329109

You can install this plugin by copying the folder into  your QGIS plugins folder, and then adding the "Data Range Filter Legend Widget" plugin. The widget is then available in the layer legend widgets. The plugin will hopefully soon be available in the QGIS Plugins repository. 

You can see an early version of this widget in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FapVK6dpC8&feature=youtu.be
