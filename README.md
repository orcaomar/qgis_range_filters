# qgis_range_filters
A widget for doing range filtering of QGIS data from the legend area. Motivated by needing to explore a large dataset, I wrote this question: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/328818/using-qgis-slider-for-filtering-based-on-attributes/329109#329109

You can install this plugin by copying the folder into  your QGIS plugins folder, and then adding the "Legend Data Filter Sliders" should work. The plugin is still not available in plugin search because some kinks need to get worked out.
