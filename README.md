# qgis_range_filters
A widget for doing range filtering of QGIS data from the legend area. Motivated by needing to explore a large dataset, I wrote this question: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/328818/using-qgis-slider-for-filtering-based-on-attributes/329109#329109

Please note, this only works from the Python Console in QGIS. Tested in QGIS 3.6. You need to copy all files into your QGIS project working directory and then load up the data_layer_range_filter_widget.py

You can see this in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FapVK6dpC8&feature=youtu.be

I plan to turn this into an actual widget one day soon.
